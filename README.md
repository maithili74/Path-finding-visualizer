# Path Finding Visulizer

**Overview**

This project implements a grid-based pathfinding visualization program in Python using Pygame. The program integrates advanced pathfinding algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra’s Algorithm. Users can visualize and analyze results such as time elapsed, nodes visited, and time and space complexity. 

**Introduction**

The project aims to provide a visual representation of pathfinding algorithms on a grid. Users can explore and understand the behavior of different algorithms by observing the visualization of their execution. The program also offers detailed information about the pathfinding process, including metrics like time elapsed, nodes visited, and time and space complexity.

**Algorithms**

The following pathfinding algorithms are integrated into the program:

* Depth-First Search (DFS)
* Breadth-First Search (BFS)
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm

**Features**

Key features of the program include:

* Algorithm Selection: Users can choose between DFS, BFS, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
* Visualization: The grid-based visualization allows users to see how the selected algorithm navigates through obstacles.
* Result Analysis: Detailed information about the pathfinding process is provided, including time elapsed, nodes visited, and time and space complexity.
